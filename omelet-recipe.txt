Recipe for a Basic Omelet

Ingredients
    4 eggs
    20g butter
    Salt and Pepper for seasoning

1   Beat eggs and 2 tablespoons cold water in a bowl until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat grill on high.
2   Heat a medium frying pan over medium-high heat until just warm. Add butter. Tilt pan back and forth until butter sizzles.
3   Beat eggs again. Pour into pan. Tilt pan so eggs cover base. Using a wooden spoon, drag cooked egg from outer edge into centre.
    Tilt pan so uncooked egg comes into contact with base.
4   Place pan under grill. Grill until lightly browned.
5   Serve hot and enjoy!
